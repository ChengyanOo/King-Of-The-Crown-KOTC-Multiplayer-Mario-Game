Comments: The EnemyPiranhaPlantState works similiarly to the Goomba and Koopa classes, except that its movements are done periodically as the Piranha is suppsoed 
to pop out of pipes every X amount of time. The class structure is well organized and well implemented inside of our code. However some changes is more inline with our decision to 
make the Enemy's states rather than Entitites. Overall the class is very easy to understand and interpret, which is helpful for when whenever our other team members needs to use 
the EnemyPiranhaPlantState. 
TimeTaken:  25 min
Changes: If I could change this class, I would have made Piranha an entity rather than a State as it isn't changing states, it's only moving up and down.
