Comments: This sprint was mostly done through a series of small classes. Mostly we dealt with the subscriber pattern. This is the delegate subscriber pattern variant that was discussed in class. It is pretty simple
and self explanatory. It does its job to keep track of the points, adding points on all subscribed events. This implementation is interesting, I prefer to do the more manual one that has the Add and Remove 
subscribers more explicitely. However this seems to be a shorter and simpler way to manage events.

TimeTaken:  10 min
Changes: In the future  would add ways to decrease the score as we move on to a different game.
