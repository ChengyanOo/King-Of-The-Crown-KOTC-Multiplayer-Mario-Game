Description: Life tracker is a pretty standard file, it follows the event design pattern and controls the player lives. 
The life tracker is implemented throughout or codebase mostly effectivly, following the event pattern. The implmentation of the tracker looks
correct as we have a decrease and increase life function. There are two decrease life functions however, the latter does not follow event pattern.
This is ideally not something neccesary as we should always be using the event system. Having the reset level code in the decrease life function is
not ideal as it is not the responsibilitty of the decrease life function to reset the level. The reset level function should be somewhere else. 
Furthermore, the implementation of the life tracker events is slightly overcomplicated in the codebase as we have to make a delegate void event and
then a function that calls the delegate. This is not ideal as we can just use the eventhandler already built into c#.

Changes:
 We can remove the extra DecreaseLife() function as it is not even being used, and does not follow the event pattern. From there we should also expand
reset level to be it's own check on not a direct part of decrease life. Finally we should remove the delegate void event and just use the eventhandler like
done with the pointtracker. This is the recommended method from microsoft and is the most efficient way to implement events.
