	Looking at the PauseState and the PlayState, I think this code could been improved. Instead of only reading the
	keyboard inputs, the pause state should has a new map of keyboard controllers. The play state basically inherites
	the same code from the last sprint. For the GameOverState and Game1(line 205-216), I think the basic functionalities
	has been met, but the game over screen could have been done a little better. Maybe considering change a way of formatting
	the game stats in the game over screen. Overall, I think GameOverState, PauseState, and PlayState could haven been done
	better.
Changes: 
	In the future, I suggest having a new map of keyboard commands when the game is paused, rather than using the same one as
	the PlayState. I also suggest making GameOverState screen looking better, rather than just a black screen with stats that
	formmated the same way as during the game play.
