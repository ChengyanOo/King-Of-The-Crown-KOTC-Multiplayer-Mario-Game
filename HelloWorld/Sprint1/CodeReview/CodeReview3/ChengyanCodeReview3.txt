Comments: 
	Both GoombaEnemyEntity.cs and KoopaEnemyEntity.cs instantiates the EnemyEntity class and defiens behaviors for
	Koopa and Goomba entities. But each method inside the sub-classes has the same body as the super class, so there
	are couple of things that could have been done better. One of them would be remove all the redundant code
	from the sub classes and the super classes. The other one would be maybe consider delete both sub classes since
	behaviors for enemies are similar.
Changes: 
	In the future sprints, I suggest either remove GoombaEnemyEntity.cs and KoopaEnemyEntity.cs, and then define all
	the enemy entity behaviors in the EnemyEntity class, or rework of these three classes and remove all the redundant
	code. The EnemyEntity now is a little confusing since we are not actually using KoopaEnemyEntity class.
