Comments: Overall I believe that Yann's implementation of the EnemyKoopaState and EnemyShellState is organized quite well as it share a lot of similiarities with my EnemyGoombaState.
Moreover in the EnemyShellState, it is also well documented and incooperates a timer to switch the Koopa back from Shell to a Koopa. Moreover it incoorperates Kush's rigid body physics
system well and is easy to understand. Overall these 2 files are well made and easy to understand between any of the other HelloWorld Team Members. However I think a thing to consider to 
fix would be the removal of the EnemyKoopaEntity class as it is not being used within the project. 
TimeTaken:  35 min
Changes: Remove the EnemyKoopaEntity as it is no longer used and perhaps considerring making the class look exactly like EnemyGoombaState to make it easier to understand as they'd be 
almost the same
