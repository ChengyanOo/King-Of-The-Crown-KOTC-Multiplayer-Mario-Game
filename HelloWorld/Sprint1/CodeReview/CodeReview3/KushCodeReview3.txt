Description: This class is used to detect collisions between two objects. It contains all the methods for the sweeping collisions and movine the player correctly
according to said collisions. The main purpose of the class is to detect moving objects to then check collisions against via the quadtree instead of everything.
This is done to increase performance and decrease the amount of collisions that are checked. The class contains a lot of methods that have no comments and was very 
confusing to understand at first. However after some analysis it is pretty straight forwards as the variables and methods are named accordingly. I do think the 
method for collision detection in general is overcomplicated and could be simplified.
Changes:
 adding comments to the class and methods. However i would also probably simplify down how collisions are checked by building it off the rigidbody system instead
of the old transformation system which is clunky and over complicated. This would be easier as we could use velocity values to determine moving objects and effect
the collision collider in a similar way. This is perhaps something to do for next time.
