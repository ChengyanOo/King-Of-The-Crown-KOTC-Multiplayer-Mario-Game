FileAuthors: Riley Downs
Comments: Overall, Riley's LevelLoader folder contains the Level.cs, FakeLevel.xml, and XMLlevelReader.cs files and is for the most
part quite organized. However the problem with his code was that it was not very well documented, which proved to be a struggle
because of Riley's absense from the Sprint due to being sick. As a result, it was difficult to understand what each function was 
doing. Even so, it still overall made sense but just took the team a little to understand it and the quality followed most of 
the proper coding practices.
TimeTaken:  35 min
Changes: A large change I would like to see in the future is detailed documentation and comments in regards to how to use his
level loader as it will become a key part of the future sprints for the class.
