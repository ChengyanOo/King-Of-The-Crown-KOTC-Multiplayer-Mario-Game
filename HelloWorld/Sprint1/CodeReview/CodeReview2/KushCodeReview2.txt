Comments: The Player entity class contains a lot of the logic for the player. It is the class that controls the player factories and state contorls for the player. 
A majority of the code appears to be constructors/generalized functions to be used elsewhere. The bottom of the class contains setState and setSprite methods 
which change sprite enum values. The class also contains all the methods to change the player states, although there are a lot of these methods. Some of the if
statements can be simplified as well.
TimeTaken: 27 min
Changes: I would recommend stripping down and splitting up the class as it is a bit too large. I would also recommend simplifying the if statements and perhaps adding
some comments as there are almost no comments in the code, even in some of the larger methods like setState() which took me a few tries to fully understand what it did.
Overall the script is pretty straightforward and easy to understand even if it does handle a bit too much.
