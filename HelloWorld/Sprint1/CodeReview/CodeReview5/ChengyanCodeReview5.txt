In the PlayerEntity class, Kush created a CooldownTimer method that prevents user from spamming the steal button to steal the crown, and I beloieve that was well done.
Kush used gameTime to calculate the total elapsed time and set a cool down time of 1 second. By reseting the elapsed time each time the user hits the steal button, we
are able to prevent user spamming the button. The only change I would make to this method is to use System.Timer instead of gameTime, since System.Timer gives you an
individual timer, so that we don't have to depend on the gameTime.

In the PowerState class, Kush created a stealCrown method, which handles tranfering the crown by calculating if the crown's and player's collider boxs  are near each other,
and if yes, the crown will be transfered to the player. Combining with the CooldownTimer, Kush is able to fulfill the functionality that the crown could be gained by getting
near to it, and prevent user from spamming steal button at the same time. Besides, during game play and testing, there were no bugs found around this functionality, so I believe
it was well done.
