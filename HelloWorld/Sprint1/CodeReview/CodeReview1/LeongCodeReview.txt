Comments: 
The overall code quality can be quite haphazard in which many of our variables and structure were mostly copied from either our previous attempts
or files that shared a similar format. Throughout the SPrint we had to remake or start from the beginning in regards to how we wanted to implement 
Sprites and Entities, as a resut we actually had to create a file with New Attached to it because we restarted the sprites.
Looking over the file, it is mostly very straightforward  in terms of understanding how it works, however our variable names can be vague at times, as
our variables were occasionally the same name as our called cs files' names(ex: texture). Despite this, the overall quality was quite easy to understand. 
When we used NewSprite in Game1.cs, the implementation was quite smoothe and did not clump up Game1 with unnecessary code. Overall our NewSprite and the 
NewSprites folder as a whole was very clean when considering how we inccorperated our sprites in our codebase and when creating our functions.

Changes: If I had to recommend a change for the future, I think that we could rename a lot of our variables to be more clearer on what it's meant to do. 
At least renaming IsVisible and isVisible to something more meaningful and different from one and another. When I was working on my tasks, I would struggle
to understand which variable was which until I understood what the differering colors meant. The fact that I needed to match the colors to the definition and 
declaration provides me with justification for this possible change in the future. Moreover, I believe that this change would not be too dificult and would only 
require Team Hello World to change the variable names inside of the Sprite related files as they also use the same variable naming scheme.
