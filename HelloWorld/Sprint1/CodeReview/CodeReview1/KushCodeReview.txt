Comments: 
	Initial glance shows a few things that can be cleaned up. Firstly, there arent any comments in the code,
	and while most of the variables are self explanatory, it would be nice to have a few comments to explain 
	important functions and lines. The code is broken up into functions well. Some of the names can be simplified
	by removing unneccessary calls to this, such as lines 27 and 28. Line 62 collects the time since last frame
	however it does this as an int which could could cause skipping or rounding issues. A minor thing is that the
	function naming scheme seems to alternate between camel case and pascal case. This should be cast to a float. 
	Overall the code is well written and easy to read. Integration into other scripts is also smooth as seen
	in NewSprite.cs which simply creates an animation.
TimeTaken: 23 Mins
Changes: 
	For future sprints, I think the organization of this script can be simplified and the constructors for rows
	and columns feel too big. Similarly the constructor can be simplified by removing calls to this, which would also 
	help with organization. Perhaps some comments for getSourceRectangle to explain what it does in plain english to
	help save time could also be useful.
