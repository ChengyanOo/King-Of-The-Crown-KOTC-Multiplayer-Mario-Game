Comments: 
The code for States is quite coupled with Entities, Commands, and Factories. This can create a lot of dnagerous situations 
and bugs along with code smells as which parts of the code should have access to variables and methods gets muddied.
On the other hand, code might have had been developed for sections that were not needed for example stairs, and floors.
This can be addressed by merging many of the classes and handling these differences in subclasses.
Finally, a lot of information had to be pased to handle the explosion of the blocks, this information is used by only one
of the method overrides.

TimeTaken: 12 min

Changes:
For future sprints I would add methods to Entities, and States to facilitate the exchange of information such that they can be decoupled
and do not need internal information about the working of the other. Moreover, I would pull the handling of the Explosion blocks outside
of the States. This method was very hard coded and required extensive knowledge of most of the program. This should definetly be handled outside.
This way it won't have dangerous data access. Finally I would consider merging block types that have limited methods and if necesary add them over
time through proper sublclassing.
